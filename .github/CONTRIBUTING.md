# Contributing
To get involved with this project, you'll need to do a few things.

## Before You Start

There are a few tools and design patterns that every front end developer for this project must familiarize themselves with:

- Redux and react-redux - Components that need to be aware of user permissions have to read it from the Redux store. To do so, you must use the `connect` function from react-redux. `src/components/NavBar/NavBarContainer.js` is an example of this, as is `src/components/Auth/RequireAuth.js`.
- firebase - This project is using firebase while the backend is under development. Everyone working on this project should know how to use the firebase web API.
- Grommet - Grommet is the UX library used in this project. Developers should be familiar the components it provides.
- The higher-order components design pattern - For components that can only be accessed by certain users, we have a higher order component (HOC) called `RequireAuth` that is used to check the current user's permissions. The component calling `RequireAuth` must pass it a JavaScript object containing the permissions it requires. An example of this is `src/routes/Activity/components/Activity.js`. The permissions assigned to each user type are defined in `src/redux/actions.js`, so if your component requires new permissions you must add them there as well.
- react-router - This project uses react-router to manage UI with respect to the URL. Examples of how to use it can be found in `src/appRoute.js` and `src/routes/Activity/index.js`.
- React

## Making Changes

1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). **NPM 3.0 or above is required to build grommet**. Node.js 5.0.0 or above comes packaged with an acceptable version of NPM. People with versions of Node.js below 5.0.0 should upgrade to the latest stable version. Node.js 6.5.0 or above is preferred for developers working on the project. Anything below that cannot be guaranteed to function properly.
2. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/TTUSDC/CPCEEDWebApp.git` in the location of your choice.
3. Download the dependencies by running `npm install` when you're in the project directory.
4. Visit the wiki at https://github.com/TTUSDC/CPCEEDWebApp/wiki to learn about the developer guidelines for this project.

Once you've started making changes, you'll need to make sure the app still runs properly.
To use the testing server, do the following:

1. Run `npm start` from the project directory.
2. Enter `localhost:8080` into the URL bar of your browser to see the app.
