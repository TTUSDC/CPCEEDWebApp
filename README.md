# CPCEED Web App
This is a time logging app for the CPCEED program at Texas Tech University.

## Developers
To get involved with this project, you'll need to do a few things:

1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). **Your installation of NPM must be at least version 3.0**. Without NPM 3.0+ grommet will fail to build properly and you will get errors. The easiest way to ensure you have a version of NPM that works is to update to the latest version.
2. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/TTUSDC/CPCEEDWebApp.git` in the location of your choice.
3. Download the dependencies by running `npm install` when you're in the project directory.
4. Visit the wiki at https://github.com/TTUSDC/CPCEEDWebApp/wiki to learn about the developer guidelines for this project.

Once you've started making changes, you'll need to make sure the app still runs properly.
To use the testing server, do the following:

1. Run `npm start` from the project directory.
2. Enter `localhost:8080` into the URL bar of your browser to see the app.

If you're not familiar with the technology stack used in this project, the wiki has links to tutorials and general resources.
